		<div class = "Page2text"><p> You reach the dent in the wall and discover a trap door. It is not locked. You decide to go in. Taking one last look at the world behind you, you prepare for whatever awaits behind that door. After all, anything would be better than your life before. You descend down a narrow set of stairs. After what feels like forever, you can finally distinguish the end of the stairs. The room is dimly lit by neon lights that flicker from time to time. It takes a while for you to adjust with the lighting.</p>
		<a href = "Page 3.1.html"><p> > LOOK AROUND </p></a>
		<p> The room is very spacious and cold. The floor is made of marble tiles that form a strange pattern. Portraits hang on the wall. They stare at you with piercing eyes, you feel like they follow you as you walk through the room. You blame it on your mind playing tricks on you. The room is in the shape of a pentagon. Four doors stand before you. </p>
