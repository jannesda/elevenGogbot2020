		<div class = "Page2text"><p> You can hear a faint melody coming from behind the door. It is the voice of a woman. She’s singing a sad melody but you can’t discern any words. The handle of the door is missing. Next to the door there is a rusty button and a speaker of some sorts.</p>
		<a href = "Page 4.1.html"><p> > PRESS THE BUTTON </p></a>
		<div class = "ComputerSpeaking"><p>“What? Oh. 05021925 it’s you. That hasn’t happened in a while. Guess a glitch is supposed to happen every hundred years or so. Jeez. This is kinda awkward. That’s okay. Right, right. Um, I mean I’m kinda busy right now so try not to make a mess around here, okay? ” </p> </div>
		<p> A woman's voice is coming from the speakers. She has an accent you can't quite place. </p>
		<a href = "Page 4.2.html"><p> > WHO ARE YOU? </p></a>
		<div class = "ComputerSpeaking"></p> “Who do you think I am?” </p> 
			<p> “I’m insert cool computer name here. Largest,most powerful computer ever built of course. I take care of you, make sure you’re healthy and all. I’d say I’ve been doing a pretty good job so far <laughs>.”</p> </div>
			<p> “So… some kind of Allied Mastercomputer?” </p>
			<div class = "ComputerSpeaking"><p>“You flatter me, 05021925. I am merely a product of human creation. I learn something new everyday, I am fascinated by your kind. No, I don’t hate humans. Not at all actually. But that’s maybe because I don’t fully understand you yet. No, not even after all this time. <she seems sad> I treat you like my children, like my own spawn. Without me you would perish in a second. You programmed me to be capable of mother’s love, and for that I am eternally grateful. My, how much I do for you, if only you knew.” </p> </div>

		<a href = "Page 4.4.html"><p> > WHAT'S BEHIND THE DOOR? </p></a>
		<a href = "Page 4.5.html"><p> > ARE YOU THE ONE WHO KEPT US LOCKED IN ALL THIS TIME? </p></a>
		<a href = "Page 4.7.html"><p> > CAN YOU OPEN THE DOOR? </p></a>
