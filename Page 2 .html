		<div class = "Page2text"><p> You find yourself in front of the Great Pyramid that you have spent 2 centuries staring at. It is unlike anything you’ve ever imagined. You guess that it is hundreds of miles high but even that seems to be an underestimation. Upon closer inspection, you notice that it is made of a strange black metal, rusty in some parts. You can’t quite place the source of the sound but it seems that there is a faint buzz coming from somewhere inside the building. What do you do next? </p>
