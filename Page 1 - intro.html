		<div class = "Introtext"<p>Humanity has been enslaved for 214 years. Nobody is allowed to leave their homes and every person is mysteriously kept alive by the PYRAMID. They watch the PYRAMID from their windows day and night. Time became irrelevant a century ago. They all answer to the PYRAMID who keeps them alive and healthy. Never too hungry or thirsty, confined in a small space for years and years and years. Most have already forgotten, but the PYRAMID was built in order to provide safety and comfort. The PYRAMID protected humanity from many dangers that wouldâ€™ve made them extinct a long time ago. A supercomputer that watches over all and ensures the survival of humanity no matter what. However, the cost of safety may have been too high. Many have been driven to insanity. The ones who try to end their pain have only met with failure. Their time ends when the computer decides.  </p>
