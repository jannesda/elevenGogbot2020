		<div class = "ComputerSpeaking"><p>“What? Oh. 05021925 it’s you. That hasn’t happened in a while. Guess a glitch is supposed to happen every hundred years or so. Jeez. This is kinda awkward. That’s okay. Right, right. Um, I mean I’m kinda busy right now so try not to make a mess around here, okay? ” </p> </div>
